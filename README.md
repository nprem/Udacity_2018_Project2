## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

## How to open the game
Open your browser and type in the path to the index.html page in the address bar using the syntax below:
file:///C:/xxx/xxx/index.html. The browser should support css and html5.

## How to play
Please click on each card to open the card. After two cards are opened, if they do not match, they will be automatically closed. If they do match, they will remain open. A timer displays the time taken to match the cards while the game is in progress. A moves counter displays the number of moves made. Additonally, a star rating is displayed. The star rating is initialized with three stars as soon as the game starts. If the number of moves made is greater than ten but less than fifteen - the star rating is downgraded to two. For moves greater than or equal to fifteen, the star rating is further downgraded to one. The aim of the game is to match all the cards in the deck in the least number of moves. Once all the cards in the deck have been matched, a modal dialog displays a congratulation message which includes the time taken, the total moves made and the star rating as well as a button which can be clicked to play the game again. There is also a Restart button on the web page which can be clicked to start the game over at any time.
